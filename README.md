# huggingface, llm and streamlit

This is a quick test of huggingface model - image-to-text, openai model and streamlit

- First, use pipeline to invoke model, and then generate text from the uploaded image

- Second, pass the generated text to llm and llm will generate a short story based on the prompt

- Third, implement streamlit ui to upload image and display output on web ui.
